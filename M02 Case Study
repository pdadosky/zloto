# M02 Case Study
#
# This program will accept data on students and determine if the student is on the Honor Roll
# and the Dean's List.
# The student qualifies as an Honor Roll student if the student's GPA is a 3.25 or better.
# The student qualifies for the Dean's List if the student's GPA is a 3.5 or better.
# If the student qualifies for neither, then the program will display the message "Student does not qualify.".
# Continue to accept student data unless a last name of "ZZZ" is entered.
#
# Initialize variables
#
gpa = 0.0
lastName = ""
firstName = ""
#
# Enter a student last name
#
lastName = input("Enter student last name or ZZZ to quit: ")
# Loop to process students
#
while lastName != "ZZZ":
    firstName = input("Enter first name: ")
    gpa = float(input("Enter student GPA: "))
    if gpa >= 3.5:
        print() # Skip a line of output
        print("Student is on the Dean's List.")
    else:
        if gpa >= 3.25:
            print() # Skip a line of output
            print("Student is on the Honor Roll.")
        else:
            print("Student does not qualify for Honor Roll.")
    print()
    lastName = input("Enter student last name or ZZZ to quit: ")
